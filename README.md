readability
===========
Description
    The tool checks your texts against the following readability tests:
	* Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease
	* Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
	* Gunning Fog Score
	* Coleman-Liau index
	* SMOG index
	* Automated readability index
	It is also possible to display statistics of your text. This includes the number of sentences, words and syllables. Using an experimental feature of the tool you will be able to detect formal and most common English words in your texts and highlight them. You may also wish to save the resulting report as an RTF file.
	Currently, only English is supported.
